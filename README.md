# Scal

The Scal framework provides implementations and benchmarks for concurrent
objects.  The benchmarks show the trade-off between concurrent data structure
semantics and scalability.

Homepage: http://scal.cs.uni-salzburg.at

## Dependencies

* pkg-config
* cmake
* [googletest](https://code.google.com/p/googletest "googletest")
* [gflags](https://code.google.com/p/gflags/ "gflags")
* [google-perftools](https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/ "google-perftools")

On Ubuntu (&ge; 12.04) based systems:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool google-perftools libgoogle-perftools-dev cmake libgtest-dev
    wget https://gflags.googlecode.com/files/libgflags0_2.0-1_amd64.deb
    wget https://gflags.googlecode.com/files/libgflags-dev_2.0-1_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i libgflags0_2.0-1_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i libgflags-dev_2.0-1_amd64.deb

A similar script is executed on our [continuous integration test.](https://drone.io/github.com/cksystemsgroup/scal/admin)

## Building [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/cksystemsgroup/scal/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/cksystemsgroup/scal/latest)

This is as easy as

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

See `./configure --help` for optional features, for instance compiling with
debugging symbols.

The format for the resulting binaries is `<benchmark>-<datastructure>`. Each
binary supports the `--help` parameter to show a list of supported configuration
flags.

The Scal framework should work on any recent x86 platform. However, various
tests can be performed after building the framework.

    make check

Additional data files, such as graph files, are available as submodule

    git submodule init
    git submodule update data

The resulting files reside in `data/`.

## Examples

### Producer/consumer

The most common parameters are:
* consumers: Number of consuming threads
* producers: Number of producing threads
* c: The computational workload (iterative pi calculation) between two data
  structure operations
* operations: The number of put/enqueue operations the should be performed by a
  producer

The following runs the Michael-Scott queue in a producer/consumer benchmark:

    ./prodcon-ms -producers=15 -consumers=15 -operations=100000 -c=250

And the same for the bounded-size k-FIFO queue:

    ./prodcon-bskfifo -producers=15 -consumers=15 -operations=100000 -c=250

And for Distributed Queue with a 1-random balancer:

    ./prodcon-dq-1random -producers=15 -consumers=15 -operations=100000 -c=250


Try `./prodcon-<data_structure> --help` to see the full list of available parameters.
